I am currently working hard on my HyperionDev Data Science course, which I hope will elevate my profile as a Trainee Data Scientist. I have excellent aptitude for IT and I am very positive when working alongside my peers when collaborating on projects. I am very interested in working with companies that can enhance my portfolio and help me to be more technical and professional in my career. I am very open to different ways of working and I have the ability to study and work at the same time. I hope that you will contact me if you require any further information. Thank you for looking at my profile.
